# First-Arduino-Code
This Arduino sketch controls an LED connected to pin 13, creating a specific blinking pattern. The code is designed to run on an Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno) and uses the built-in LED for simplicity.
Functionality
- In the `setup()` function:
  - Pin 13 is configured as an output to control the LED.
- In the `loop()` function:
  - The LED to blink three times with a pattern: ON for  milliseconds and OFF for 500ms each time.
  - Followed by three longer blinks: ON for 100ms and OFF for 1000ms each time.
  - This sequence repeats indefinitely, creating a rhythmic blinking effect.

Hardware Requirements
- **Arduino Board**: Any Arduino with a digital pin 13 (e.g., Arduino Uno, Nano).
- **LED**: Uses the built-in LED on pin 13 (no external components required).

Usage
- Upload the sketch to your Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.
- The LED on pin 13 will start blinking in the described pattern immediately.

Notes
- The timing of the blinks is controlled by `delay()` functions, which pause the program for specified durations (in milliseconds).
- If using an external LED, connect it to pin 13 with a current-limiting resistor (e.g., 220Î©) and ground.
